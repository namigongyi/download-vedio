Anna Bones discovered rope, with her now-husband Fred Hatt, in 2013 and has been in love with it ever since.



Rope quickly escalated from a side hobby to a full-time job, culminating in the opening of Anatomie Studio (a sex positive venue and the UK's largest and first full-time Shibari space) which she runs with Fred Hatt since 2015.



Anna has taught and performed with her partner all over the world, but her favourite place is still her local hub, where welcoming and teaching beginners is her main passion. From self-tying, bottoming and rigging, Anna loves it all, although she finds being tied the greatest joy of all.



Anna enjoys learning from different teachers and about different Shibari styles, so when she teaches she can cover a range of techniques and approaches. Regardless of motivation or dynamic, she believes rope can be a great tool for self discovery and for building trust and intimacy within healthy partnerships.
