Tamandua (he/him) is a full time rope artist and Shibari instructor based in Berlin.

He has a deep love for the aesthetic realm of kinbaku. Having learned from a broad variety of teachers, partners and collaborators the strongest influence on his approach is a mix between more 'classical' sensual Japanese Semenawa (tormenting rope) and the wildly deconstructed styles of some European riggers.



He views Kinbaku as a thing of continuous exploration â€“ where new doors open as you go deeper and further with a partner, over the course of a session or over the course of a longterm partnership. Sometimes though, the magic that defines Kinbaku can be just that one alluring image that sticks with you, a moment suspended in time.



For him, the core of Kinbaku lies in the meeting between the aesthetic expression and the emotional intention of the practice.
