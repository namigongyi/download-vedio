Fuoco (she/her) began her rope journey as a bottom in Phoenix, Arizona in early 2013 and shortly thereafter moved to London, where much of her early rope learning happened. Upon moving back to the United States, she began presenting at cons around the country sharing her love of rope.





She is switchy in rope, a vocal advocate for rope bottoms, and an unapologetic feminist as she navigates the world of Shibari. As an educator, she's decidedly non-dogmatic in her approach to teaching. Her classes instead aim to teach bottoms to better understand their bodies and the unique needs of their anatomies and to offer riggers the tools to adapt their tying accordingly and understand the logic behind those adaptations.





When sheâ€™s not doing rope, fuoco is a professional acrobat, constantly training to build strength, flexibility, and body awareness. Her dedicated study of the mechanics of the body make her especially interested in developing more comprehensive education for bottoms informed by these practices.
