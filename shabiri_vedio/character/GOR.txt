Gorgone (they/she) is a French rope switch living in Berlin and co-founder of Shibari Study. Their method and approach to rope is deeply inﬂuenced by their personal practice of yoga and conscious movement together with 10 years of intense professional experience on both sides of the rope. Their teaching is directed to both riggers and models, guiding them into developing active, conscious and efﬁcient partnerships in order to create safer and more successful rope experiences.



She takes time to deconstruct everything she teaches, from the most basic to the most complex ties, and always addresses both the rope’s and body’s mechanics of a tie or position. Her pedagogy focuses on encouraging and developing technical autonomy, freedom and creativity in the student’s practice while maintaining a fundamental background of safety, knowledge and awareness.



With Gorgone you will not only learn the ‘how’ but also the ‘why’ behind each tie so you can adapt or modify a harness or position to each new partner and situation and fully incorporate it into your own unique practice.
