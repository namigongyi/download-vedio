Hajime Kinoko (he/him) took up rope for the first time in 2001, because his then-girlfriend was interested in rope. When the rope master Akechi Denki held a workshop at the club he was working at, Kinoko really learned the meaning of tying people.



In 2008, Kinoko began taking lessons from Nawashi Kanna, who was a student of Akechi Denki. From Kanna, Kinoko learned to tie intricately and beautifully. The Gote shibari that Kinoko now teaches is based on Kanna’s tying and slightly customized.



Later Kinoko met Haruki Yukimura, and took lessons from him for several years. From Yukimura, Kinoko learned how to interact with models, how to show a model’s body line in an aesthetically pleasing way, among other techniques.



In 2018, most of the techniques Kinoko has been teaching are based on Kanna’s method whom he refers to as his former teacher to express his gratitude for using his method for 10 years.
