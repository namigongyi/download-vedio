Fred Hatt (hehim) regularly teaches classes for a wide range of levels at Anatomie Studio in London, which he and his partner Anna Bones founded in 2015. They also teach - and sometimes perform - outside of the UK. His classes focus as much on the ‘how’ as well as the ‘why’ behind what we tie in rope. Fred's style of teaching is rather technical, with an attention to the small details that can make or break a tie. 



Fast and surprising dynamic transitions and predicament Shibari are Fred's favourite flavours of rope. Fred Hatt is a somewhat introverted and definitely caring rigger who enjoys sharing what he knows with his partners and students.
